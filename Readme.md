# West Wind Album Viewer ASP.NET Core Sample

This is a forked version of [Album Viewr Sample](https://github.com/dockersamples/dotnet-album-viewer) by dockersamples which itself is forked from [Rick Srahl's app](https://github.com/RickStrahl/AlbumViewerVNext). This version  is compatible with the new style of containerising  .NET Core applications. 

### Application Design

**Sample Angular (4) application demonstrating ASP.NET Core API features**

This is a sample ASP.NET Core application that demonstrates basic features of ASP.NET Core in an API backend application with an Angular frontend. The application allows browsing and editing of a list of albums and artists interactively.

* Custom User Authentication
* CORS Support
* Using ASP.NET Core as a backend to an Angular 2.0 front end

The sample also includes a few Server Side Rendered MVC pages for browsing and viewing of albums and artists. I'll be adding the edit pages at a later point.

* Page based Application
* Mobile friendly, adaptive UI
* Routing
* Animations and Page Transitions
* Client side and server side Authentication tracking
* Client side and server side Validation
* Managing Server Urls (dev/production)
* Angular CLI Project

Version supported:  
* **Angular 4.33**  
* **Angular CLI 1.27**

### Docker Features
The **Docker** setup demonstrates:

* Docker Windows containers
* Multi-stage Docker builds
* Optimized building and packaging of .NET Core apps
* MySQL Server running in a container

Versions supported:
* **Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016**
* **Docker 17.06+ (CE or EE)**

### Getting Started - using Docker on Windows ###

To build your own image of Album Viewer Application, 

```
docker build -t  username/dotnet-album-viewer . 

```

Launch the database container with TiDB ( a MySQL compatible database) as, 

```
docker run --name tidb -idt --rm -p 3306:4000 dockersamples/tidb:nanoserver-sac2016

```

Find out the IP address of TiDB container with , 

```
docker inspect tidb --format="{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress}}"
```

Now launch the Album Viewer App as, 

```
docker run -it --rm  -p 80:80 \ 
-e "Data:Provider=MySQL" \
 -e "Data:ConnectionString=Server=172.17.187.15;Port=4000;Database=AlbumViewer;User=root;SslMode=None"  \ 
schoolofdevops/dotnet-album-viewer

```

where, 172.17.187.15 is the IP address of TiDB, found using the command above. Replace this with the actual IP address of TiDB container.  Also replace schoolofdevops in the image tag with your own, if you have built an image of yours. Keep it unchanged in case if you have not. 


#### Platforms 
Currently the app has been tested to run under Windows and Mac, but it should also work under Linux.
